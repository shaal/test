#### Description
The HTML H1â€“H6 elements represent six levels of section headings. H1 is the highest section level and H6 is the lowest. In order to write accessible and semantic content via the WYSIWYG, it is important to use the proper heading level so that users who rely on screen readers can more easily navigate your website and so that SEO robots can better understand the structure and content of your page.
