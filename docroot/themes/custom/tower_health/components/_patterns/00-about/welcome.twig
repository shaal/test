    <h2>{{ client_name }}'s Living Styleguide</h2>

    <p>The style guide primarily acts to establish and maintain consistent design patterns across a project.</p> 
    <p>It also serves as a communication tool; communicating code and content decisions between the strategists, designers, and developers on a project, communicating content strategy and best practices to stakeholders and content creators, and communicating project progress and design to stakeholders.</p>

    <p>This styleguide is based on the <a href="http://patternlab.io/">PatternLab Atomic Design System</a>.</p>
