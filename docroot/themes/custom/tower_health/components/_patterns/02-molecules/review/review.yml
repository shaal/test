review: 'Today I came in with my 4 month old. I was being a bit paranoid, the receptionist was so kind and said "No, you are just being a good mama". The staff was awesome they called the nurse right away and the nurse and the doctor both came in a timely manner to check him. The doctor was very thorough in ensuring he was okay and helped ease my mind. I was very shaky when I showed up and they treated me so well. I was very happy. Thank you to everyone there and for taking such good care of my little man and easing my mind.'
