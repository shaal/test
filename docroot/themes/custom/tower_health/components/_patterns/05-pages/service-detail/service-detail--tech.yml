    paragraph_content:
      "For patients, having a digital mammogram is very much like having a conventional screen-film mammogram. Both film-based and digital mammography use compression and x-rays to create clear images of the inside of the breast. But digital mammography offers the ability to manipulate images (zoom, adjust the contrast) and potentially reduce radiation exposure, ability to adjust the imageâ€™s brightness and contrast reduces the need for retakes due to over or under exposure."
