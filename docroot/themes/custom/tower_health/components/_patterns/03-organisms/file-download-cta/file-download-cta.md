#### Description
The File Download Call to Action contains a title, description, an image of a document, and a link to download that document. 

A secondary download link has been added to allow for adding in translations for download. This secondary link should only be used for translations so that the title/image can remain consistent. 

The title and image still link to the primary file download.
