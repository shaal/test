// Global Breakpoints

// The max-width breakpoint is used when the design should be applied at whatever the
// largest breakpoint is regardless of actual pixel value. e.g. removing outer margin on body wrapper
$max-width: $bp5;

/// Mixin - xs Breakpoint
/// Allows easier @include xs {} syntax
@mixin bp1 {
  @include breakpoint($bp1) {
    @content;
  }
}

/// Mixin - small Breakpoint
/// Allows easier @include small {} syntax
@mixin bp2 {
  @include breakpoint($small) {
    @content;
  }
}

/// Mixin - medium Breakpoint
/// Allows easier @include medium {} syntax
@mixin bp3 {
  @include breakpoint($bp3) {
    @content;
  }
}

/// Mixin - large Breakpoint
/// Allows easier @include large {} syntax
@mixin bp4 {
  @include breakpoint($bp4) {
    @content;

}

/// Mixin - xl Breakpoint
/// Allows easier @include xl {} syntax
