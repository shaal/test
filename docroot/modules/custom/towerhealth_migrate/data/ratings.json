He and his staff have always been very professional and supportive during a very emotional time in my life! I highly recommend him as a GYN/Oncology surgeon! If Reading Hospital ever needs a patient to help market his exceptional GYN/Oncology Surgical care, I would be honored to help! My whole experience with him and his practice has been exceptional! Thank you, Dr. V!",
